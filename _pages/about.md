My research focuses on improving the security for computing hardware and systems. My research interests include cache side-channels, transient execution attacks, Rowhammer attacks, DRAM integrity, memory safety and fuzzing. Some of my research contributions include:
* **Cache Side-Channels**: Enabled the fastest known cache timing attacks \[[1]({{ 'ASPLOS21_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\], randomized cache defenses \[[2]({{ 'SEC21_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] that end an arms race, and one of the first academic hardware defenses against Spectre \[[3]({{ 'MICRO19_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\].
* **DRAM Security**: Enabled practical  mitigations for DRAM Rowhammer attacks \[[4]({{ 'ASPLOS22_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }}), [5]({{ 'ISCA22_Qureshi.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] and designed secure memories \[[6]({{ 'HPCA18_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }}), [7]({{ 'MICRO18_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] for protection against physical attacks.
* **Software Reliability**: Enabled hardware support for low-cost memory safety \[[8]({{ 'DSN21_Boivie.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] and fuzzing \[[9]({{ 'CCS21_Ding.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] to make software resilient to bugs causing a majority of current vulnerabilities. 

[//]: # (**My research designs low cost and principled security solutions for hardware.** I am interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of computer architecture and security, including cache side-channel resilience, transient execution attacks and defenses in processors, rowhammer attacks and memory integrity, memory safety, and others. )

[//]: # (Recently, I spent Summer'21 with [Prof. Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/)'s group at [TU Graz](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/), Austria, working on attacking memory compression and reverse-engineering new processor micro-architectures.)

[//]: # (During my PhD, I have been fortunate to intern at several industry labs, including [ARM Research](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) (Summer'17) on DRAM integrity solutions, [Intel Labs - Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) (Summer'18) on low-cost memory safety, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) (Summer'19) on principled defenses against processor-speculation attacks, and [IBM Research - Security](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=2720) (Summer'20) on hardware for memory-safety. )

My work has been awarded a **HPCA Best Paper Award**, **IEEE HOST Best PhD Dissertation Award**, **ACM SIGARCH / IEEE TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention)**, **ACM SIGMICRO Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention)**, and a **IEEE MICRO Top Picks (Honorable Mention)**. My PhD was partly supported by a GT Cybersecurity Fellowship and a GT Bourne Fellowship.

I received my PhD at [Georgia Tech](https://www.ece.gatech.edu), Atlanta, USA, where I was advised by [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~moin/). I received my B.Tech and M.Tech at [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), India. Prior to joining UofT, I was with [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research).
