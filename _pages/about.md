I am a PhD candidate *(expected graduation: August'22)* in [ECE](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/), USA, advised by [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~moin/).  My research interests in computer architecture and security include cache side-channels, transient execution attacks, Rowhammer attacks, DRAM integrity, memory safety and fuzzing.

*My research envisions a future where hardware is secure and free from vulnerabilities, and where trustworthy hardware enables low-cost pervasive security for software systems.*

**My research has enabled principled security for future hardware and systems at several layers:**
* **Cache memories**: Enabled the fastest known *cache timing attacks* \[[1]({{ 'ASPLOS21_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\], *randomized cache defenses* \[[2]({{ 'SEC21_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] ending an arms race, and one of the first academic *hardware defenses against Spectre* \[[3]({{ 'MICRO19_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\].
* **DRAM memories**: Enabled *DRAM integrity solutions* \[[4]({{ 'HPCA18_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }}), [5]({{ 'MICRO18_Saileshwar.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] that protect against physical attacks, and *principled Rowhammer mitigations* for current and emerging attacks like Half-Double and Blacksmith.
* **Software reliability**: Enabled hardware support for low-cost *memory safety* \[[6]({{ 'DSN21_Boivie.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] and *fuzzing* \[[7]({{ 'CCS21_Ding.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }})\] that makes software resilient to bugs causing a large majority of current vulnerabilities. 

[//]: # (**My research designs low cost and principled security solutions for hardware.** I am interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of computer architecture and security, including cache side-channel resilience, transient execution attacks and defenses in processors, rowhammer attacks and memory integrity, memory safety, and others. )

[//]: # (Recently, I spent Summer'21 with [Prof. Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/)'s group at [TU Graz](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/), Austria, working on attacking memory compression and reverse-engineering new processor micro-architectures.)

[//]: # (During my PhD, I have been fortunate to intern at several industry labs, including [ARM Research](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) (Summer'17) on DRAM integrity solutions, [Intel Labs - Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) (Summer'18) on low-cost memory safety, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) (Summer'19) on principled defenses against processor-speculation attacks, and [IBM Research - Security](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=2720) (Summer'20) on hardware for memory-safety. )

For my work, I have been awarded an **IEEE MICRO Top Picks Honorable Mention**, the **Georgia Tech (IISP) Cybersecurity Fellowship**, and the **Georgia Tech (ECE) Bourne Fellowship**.

I received my B.Tech & M.Tech in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), India.
