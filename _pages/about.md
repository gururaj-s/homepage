I am a final-year PhD Student  *(expected graduation: Spring'22)* in [ECE](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/), USA, advised by [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~moin/). My research is at the intersection of **Computer Architecture** & **Systems Security**.

**My research designs low cost and principled security solutions for hardware.** I am interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of computer architecture and security, including cache side-channel resilience, transient execution attacks and defenses in processors, rowhammer attacks and memory integrity, memory safety, and others.

Recently, I spent Summer'21 with [Prof. Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/)'s group at [TU Graz](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/), Austria, working on attacking memory compression and reverse-engineering new processor micro-architectures.

During my PhD, I have been fortunate to intern at several industry labs, including [ARM Research](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) (Summer'17) on DRAM integrity solutions, [Intel Labs - Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) (Summer'18) on low-cost memory safety, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) (Summer'19) on principled defenses against processor-speculation attacks, and [IBM Research - Security](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=2720) (Summer'20) on hardware for memory-safety. 

I received my B.Tech & M.Tech in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), India, with a Minor in [Computer Science](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
